# Project 1 - Personal Website

This project is a personal website hosted on AWS S3, showcasing my CV, skills, and background. It demonstrates my ability to create, deploy, and host a simple static website on the cloud. The website serves as a professional representation of my career and provides an easy way for potential employers to learn more about me.

## Role:
- **Developer**: I developed and deployed the website from scratch, designed the layout using HTML and CSS, and hosted it on AWS using services like S3. I managed the infrastructure with AWS tools to ensure smooth hosting and domain configuration.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- AWS S3
- AWS Route 53 (Optional, for custom domain setup)
- AWS CLI
- GitHub

This project is a work in progress and can be updated with new features or further customization in the future.
